## US Bikeshare data exploration
This project is a part of **udacity** [nanodegree course in data science](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104). Check their site for cool content!

### Description
This project aims to build an interactive tool for analyzing data on bikeshare in three US cities - Chicago, Washington and NYC. It provides some useful insights and statistics for a given city and a chosen period of time just upon typing some simple commands.

Data used in the project is a wrangled sample provided by udacity and originally comes from following sources: [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data) and [NYC](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

The tool was built in Python 3.7.7 using three libraries:
- Pandas
- time
- calednar

#### Use

```
python udacity_project_script.py
```

### Files used
To run the script successfully you need three files:
 - chicago.csv
 - washington.csv
 - new_york_city.csv
